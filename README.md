# Daily Inspiration Plugin

  “Quotes help us understand, inspire, motivate, clarify and show our approach to things around, this is why people and I love quotes.” *by Takyou Allah Cheikh Malaynine*

This is a simple plugin that fetches a new quote from the internet every time you open Obsidian.
## Functionality
At each Obsidian startup **one** new quote is fetched from the internet; this quote can be viewed or inserted in a file using the following functions:
1. **Startup quote:** A new quote greets you as you start Obsidian *(you can turn it off in the settings)*
2. **Read quote:** A command to make the quote appear *(you can set an hot key for this)*
3. **Quote view:** An obsidian view gets created to display the current quote *(if you close the view a command to reopen it appears in the command palette)*
4. **Insert quote in current selection**: Insert the quote in the current selection (or at cursor position) of a note - this includes a link to the author wikipedia page*(you can set an hot key for this)*

*why only one quote?* - this is to avoid wasting time scrolling through quotes; read the one you get and think about it, if it inspires you, write about it (or do what you wish) if not come back tomorrow.

## Settings
Currently the only available setting is to turn ON or OFF the startup quote popup.

If you like this plugin and would like to buy me a coffee, you can!
